# Log_core Testing Strategy

## Problem with Previous Approach

The original approach created a "standalone" version of Log_core (`log_core_standalone.h/cc`) that reimplemented the Log_core functions with simplified dependencies. This approach had fundamental issues:

1. **Not testing the real code**: The tests were validating a reimplemented version, not the actual production code
2. **Duplication of logic**: Maintaining two implementations of the same functionality
3. **Divergence risk**: The standalone version could behave differently from the real implementation
4. **False confidence**: Tests could pass on the standalone version but fail on the real code

## Correct Testing Approach

Unit tests should test the actual production code, not reimplementations. Here are better approaches:

### 1. Integration Testing
Use the full InnoDB API to test that logging functionality works:
- `test_log0core_simple.cc` demonstrates this approach
- Tests database initialization, startup, and shutdown which exercises the log system
- Validates that the real Log_core implementation can handle basic operations

### 2. Dependency Injection/Mocking
For true unit testing of Log_core:
- Mock external dependencies (file system, memory allocation, etc.)
- Test the real Log_core class with controlled inputs
- This requires refactoring the Log_core to accept dependencies as parameters

### 3. Focused Integration Tests
Create specific tests that exercise Log_core through higher-level operations:
- Transaction logging
- Recovery scenarios  
- Buffer management with logging

## Current State

- **Removed**: `log_core_standalone.h/cc` - the reimplemented version
- **Removed**: `test_log_core_standalone.cc` - tests of the fake implementation
- **Updated**: `test_log0core.cc` - now references the real Log_core header
- **Added**: `test_log0core_simple.cc` - integration test using public API

## Building Tests

The current simple integration test can be built with:
```bash
make test_log0core_simple
```

Note: This requires the full InnoDB library to be built and may have linking dependencies.

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on integration tests** that validate end-to-end functionality
2. **If unit testing is needed**, refactor Log_core to accept dependencies as parameters
3. **Test real scenarios** like crash recovery, transaction rollback, etc.
4. **Use the existing test infrastructure** in the tests directory as examples

## Files Modified

- Removed `log_core_standalone.h` and `log_core_standalone.cc`
- Removed `test_log_core_standalone.cc`
- Updated `test_log0core.cc` to include real headers
- Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to remove standalone test target
- Added `test_log0core_simple.cc` as example integration test
